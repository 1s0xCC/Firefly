Firefly v1.0
- Added file-version verification, so you are notified if you need to update your client.

Firefly v1.1
- Added a check to the rush-path for rusher.
- Fixed the off-screen textbox bug.
- Removed the edit-restriction to allow reconfiguration while a main-toggle is on (You must re-toggle for changes to take into effect).
- Changed the length-limit for the filter mesos to 5 characters instead of 4 (I would limit it to <= 50.000, but since I've seen mesos-bags with 68.000 mesos, etc., I will not do so).
- Set an automatic startup position for the game-client to (0, 0), which is the top-left corner.
- Remade the no-knockback to only target body-attacks.
- Removed the knockback unlimited attack and no knockback restriction (only one could be active at a time).
- Recast auto-skills after login.

Firefly v1.2
- Added activation toggles for single items in the tabs "Auto Botting", "Hacks", "Exclusive". You can now toggle single items on/off without toggle on/off the Main Toggle.
- Added extra suggestions to the fullmap attack and skill inject id lists in the Exclusive tab.
- Added two additional CPU hacks; "No Hit Effect" and "No Kill Text". It will effectively remove the animation of your skill hitting the enemy, and the combo/multikill texts.
- Fixed a bug in the scrollbar/listview correlation. The scrollbar now sizes itself automatically, and reset when deleting items.
- Fixed loads of bugs to the listview/tabbar correlation.
- Fixed some selection-bugs in the listview and added key up/down navigation.
- Fixed a connection bug between the trainer and MapleStory.
- Removed the tab-bar from the Map Rusher. All previous functionality is now merged into one list.
- Changed the way the suggestion id lists in the Exclusive tab looks (for easier navigation).
- I found a deadlock in the map-rusher's path generator. Will probably rewrite the entire thing (and possibly make it intercontinental).

Firefly v1.3
- Fixed a small issue with the ListView (would crash upon closure, instead of closing silently).
- Fixed a Spawn Control loading error (it generated map-names dynamically now).
- Added a wait for channel-change to the Map Rusher (it now waits for the change-channel before entering portals).
- Improved the Fullmap Attack by removing the view-limit. It now hits all mobs on the entire map (regardless of map size).
- Revamped the scrollbar. The underlying model is much different and more stable/applicable regarding other controls. The design has also improved to be more consistent with the rest of the GUI.

Firefly v1.4
- Revamped the scrollbar - again. This time to fix issues when the scrollbar was handling larger pages (e.g. listviews with over 100 elements).
- Added web-login to the Auto Login and enforced this as the only option (on March 23rd 2017, Nexon disables regular client launches).
- Added whitelist (names) for Auto Evade.
- Added "Auto NPC", "Auto Rune" and "Auto Sudden Mission" to the Hacks tab.

TODO:
- Add Blazing Extinction shit (Auto-cast, and scripts. Remember platform/airchecks)
- Add Unlimited Buff
- Add Auto NPC (Skip through NPC dialogs)
- Add Portal Teleport (Assign key to iterate through portals)
- Add GND for Skill Injection
- Add unlimited flashjump
- Add CPU-hacks for removing ingame UIs (Quest Helper, Maple Guide, Reward Points, etc.)
- Add more auto-skills (or maybe change to a manageable list).
- Xenon: Add an option to automatically choose the correct attacking skill using "Modal Shift" (it changes back to the default skill after restarting the client).
- Improve Map Rusher (use ingame rusher?).

No Delaying / Proper Skill Injection
